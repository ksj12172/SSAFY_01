# HTML

- codecademy_introduction to HTML

- two spaces of indentation

- tags : `h`,`body`, `p, div`-(block level element), `span`(inline level element),

  ​	`em, strong`, `class, id`, `br`, `ul, li, ol`  ,`img` , `alt` , `video` 

- block level element- push sibling elements to a new line or section of the page 

1.<opening tag>content </closing tag> : these are elements

opening tag : start an HTML element

tag : brower knows how to properly interpret and structure this information

- p, div, span : contain text
    ul, ol : <li>만 갖는다
    div :  can contain all tags -  body안에 존재하는 것으로

- img : self-closing tag, no content

2. body :

3. head : contains metadata - will not be displayed by the browser, title

4. ex) body tags - p tags : the child element is said to be nested inside of the parent element

   The head and body elements are siblings to each other and children to html parent.

   child elements can inherit from their parents -> behavior and styling

5. div(division or a container that divides the page into sections) : often used to group related content, contain test, links, images, or videos

   use for readability or targetability

   div 밑에 h2, p가 same level로

   ```html
   <body>
     <h1>The Brown Bear</h1>
     <div id="introduction">
       <h2>About Brown Bears</h2>
       <p>The brown bear (Ursus arctos) is native to parts of northern Eurasia and North America. Its conservation status is currently Least Concern. There are many subspecies within the brown bear species, including the Atlas bear and the Himalayan brown bear.</p>
       <h3>Species</h3>
       <h3>Features</h3>
       <p>Brown bears are not always completely brown. Some can be reddish or yellowish. They have very large, curved claws and huge paws. Male brown bears are often 30% larger than female brown bears. They can range from 5 feet to 9 feet from head to toe.</p>
     </div>
     <div id="habitat">
       <h2>Habitat</h2>
       <h3>Countries with Large Brown Bear Populations</h3>
       <h3>Countries with Small Brown Bear Populations</h3>
       <p>Some countries with smaller brown bear populations include Armenia, Belarus, Bulgaria, China, Finland, France, Greece, India, Japan, Nepal, Poland, Romania, Slovenia, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan.</p>
     </div>
     <div id="media">
       <h2>Media</h2>
     </div>
   </body>
   
   ```

6. HEADINGS IN HTML

   h1 : used for main headings, all other smaller headings are used for subheadings

   h1, h2, h3, h3, h2 순으로 body 안에 쓸 수 있음, h1에서 h3를 가질수록 글씨가 작아짐

7. **Attributes** : expand an element's tag

   content added to the opening tag

   providing information , changing styling

   name/value of the attribute

   ex) **id**: specify different content >>> <div id="intro">

   ​		identifier, unique to the whole document

   ex) **class** : whole group of elements

8. Displaying Text : paragraph(p), span

   p: contain a block of plain text

   span : separate small pieces of content that are on the same line as other content

   ex) p,span,~, /span,~,/p

9. Styling Text

   `em` tag : emphasizes text - italic

   `strong` tag : highlights important text - bold

10. Line breaks

`br` there is only a starting tag

11. Unordered Lists

`ul` : unordered list tag - should not hold raw text, 밑에 `li` tag 있어야 해 - describe an item in a list

`li`: ul이나 ol의 direct child여야만 한다

12. ordered lists `ol`

각각의 list item들이 numbered 1.~, 2. ~ 이런식으로 번호 매겨진다.

이미지 등등 ol 밑에 li에서 등록 가능

13. Images

`img` : self-closing tag

<img src="image-location.jpg" />

src가 required attribute

14. **alt** : attribute - description of the image

    <img src="#" alt="A field of yellow sunflowers" />



15. video src = "#" width="#" height="#" controls-> browser가 pause, play, skip 포함하도록

video not supported ->> video를 load할 수 없을 때 나오는 메세지

/video  >>angle bracket 표시 안함

# Review

Congratulations on completing the first lesson of HTML! You are well on your way to becoming a skilled web developer.

Let's review what you've learned so far:

1. **HTML** stands for **H**yper**T**ext **M**arkup **L**anguage and is used to create the structure and content of a webpage.
2. Most HTML elements contain opening and closing tags with raw text or other HTML tags between them.
3. HTML elements can be nested inside other elements. The enclosed element is the child of the enclosing parent element.
4. Any visible content should be placed within the opening and closing `<body>` tags .
5. Headings and sub-headings, `<h1>` to `<h6>` tags, are used to enlarge text.
6. `<p>`, `<span>` and `<div>` tags specify text or blocks.
7. The `<em>` and `<strong>` tags are used to emphasize text.
8. Line breaks are created with the `<br>` tag.
9. Ordered lists (`<ol>`) are numbered and unordered lists (`<ul>`) are bulleted.
10. Images (`<img>`) and videos (`<video>`) can be added by linking to an existing source.

In the next lesson, we'll take the content that you've added to this website and transform it into an HTML document that's ready to go on the web!
