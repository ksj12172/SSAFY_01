```html
<!DOCTYPE html> # the type of document and the HTML version to expect, not an HTML element or tag
<html>
    <head> #contains the metadata(information about the page itself) for a web page
        
    </head>
</html>



```

1. Why does the brower need metadata about the page?

- metadata is mostly "data about data"

- often use metadata to enhance the user experience
- can be used by other software (web crawlers, search engines, browers, etc.)
- to process, encode, extract or index all sorts of interesting information
- improve Search Engine Optimization
