```html
<!DOCTYPE html> # the type of document and the HTML version to expect, not an HTML element or tag
<html> # tags that enclose all of HTML code
    <head> #contains the metadata(information about the page itself) for a web page
        <title> # what a browser's tab displays, used for page indexing
        </title>
        
    </head>
</html>

- metadata is mostly "data about data"

- often use metadata to enhance the user experience
- can be used by other software (web crawlers, search engines, browers, etc.)
- to process, encode, extract or index all sorts of interesting information
- improve Search Engine Optimization

3. a - anchor element, including the text of the link 

href (hyperlink reference) - link to a path

target - how a link should open
